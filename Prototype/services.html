  <button class="accordion">Engine Oil</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p> Engine oil is what lubricates a car’s engine, allowing it to run smoothly and last longer. Car owners must maintain their cars’ engines by changing the oil and using the oil appropriate for their cars’ makes and models. Every car comes with a check oil light and an oil filter under the hood. These components allow car owners to monitor their oil levels and add oil as needed without having to hire a mechanic.

  <button class="accordion">Changing the Oil
</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p> An important part of routine car maintenance is changing the oil regularly. The necessary frequency of oil changes has become a point of contention among experts. The Engine Oil Bible maintains that engine oil can’t be changed often enough, but Nordic Group insists that, with the advent of detergent oils and multi-weight oils, some vehicles can go as far as 6,000 miles before needing an oil change. </p>
